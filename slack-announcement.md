Hey everyone! We now have a shared inventory system for the Figueroa Lab. It's live and ready to use:

Sign in with your `@seas.upenn.edu` Google account.

**What you can do:**

:package: **Inventory** — Browse all lab equipment, search by name/location/serial number, upload photos
:label: **Check Out / Return** — Track who's using what, get overdue reminders
:shopping_cart: **Order Requests** — Request new equipment with price, urgency, and purchase links
:truck: **Log Deliveries** — Record incoming packages with tracking info
:calendar: **Calendar** — See all activity at a glance

**How it works:**

1. Open the link and sign in
2. To check out an item → click it → "Quick Check Out"
3. To request new equipment → Procurement tab → "New Request"
4. To log a delivery → Procurement tab → "Log Delivery"

Everything syncs to a shared Google Sheet, so changes show up for everyone within ~30 seconds.

**Good to know:**
- Only admins can delete items (to prevent accidents)
- All deletions are logged with who did it and when
- Slack notifications will come to this channel for important updates
