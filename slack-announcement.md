:robot_face: *Introducing LabTrack — Our New Lab Inventory & Purchasing System*

Hey everyone! Starting now, the Figueroa Lab is moving to a shared digital system for tracking equipment and submitting purchase requests. No more spreadsheets, emails back and forth, or not knowing where things are. Everything lives in one place, synced in real time for the whole lab.

*What it does:*
:package: *Inventory* — Browse all lab equipment by category, search by name/location/serial, view photos and label IDs
:label: *Check Out / Return* — Track who's using what; check out multiple items at once; overdue alerts turn red
:shopping_trolley: *Order Requests* — Submit purchase requests with store, price, urgency, and purchase link; generate a formatted email table for the purchasing process
:truck: *Deliveries* — Orders auto-log a delivery and open a staging form to set location and label ID before going to inventory
:calendar_spiral: *Calendar* — Visual monthly view of all lab activity

*Quick start:*
• Check out an item → Click its card → *Quick Check Out*, or Usage tab → *New Checkout*
• Request a purchase → Order Requests tab → *New Request*
• Return items → Usage tab → check boxes → *Return selected*
• Changes sync to everyone within ~30 seconds

:warning: *A few things to know:*
• Please use this system for all purchase requests going forward
• Only *admins* can delete items — contact a lab admin if needed
• For Amazon links, use *Share → Copy link* on the product page for a short URL (e.g. `a.co/d/…`) instead of the full address bar URL — the app will remind you if you paste a long one
• When submitting an order, enter the *purchase unit* (e.g. 1 box of 100 stickers), not the inventory unit — you'll set the inventory qty when the order arrives
