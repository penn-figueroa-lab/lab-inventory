Sign in with your @seas.upenn.edu account.

*What you can do:*
:package: *Inventory* — Browse all lab equipment by category, search by name/location/serial, view photos and label IDs
:label: *Check Out / Return* — Track who's using what; check out multiple items at once; overdue alerts turn red
:shopping_trolley: *Order Requests* — Submit purchase requests with price, urgency, and purchase link; generate a formatted email table for purchasing
:truck: *Deliveries* — Orders auto-log a delivery and open a staging form to set location and label ID before going to inventory
:calendar_spiral: *Calendar* — Visual monthly view of all lab activity

*Quick start:*
• Check out an item → Click its card → *Quick Check Out*, or go to Usage tab → *New Checkout* (supports multiple items at once)
• Request something → Order Requests tab → *New Request*
• Return items → Usage tab → check boxes → *Return selected*
• Everything syncs to a shared Google Sheet within ~30 seconds

:warning: *Important:*
• Only *admins* can delete items — contact a lab admin if something needs to be removed
• All deletions are permanently logged (who, when, what)
• When submitting an order, enter the *purchase unit* (e.g. 1 box), not the inventory unit (e.g. 100 stickers) — you'll set inventory qty when the order arrives
• Categories, label ID prefixes, and admin list are managed under Settings (admins only)
